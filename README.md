# Project Description
I've implemented a project based on JavaScript concepts, using the DOM (Document Object Model) to create and manipulate web page elements without requiring direct HTML or CSS files. This approach offers a different and valuable way to create and control interface elements using JavaScript.

### Page Structure:
I created the page structure and basic elements using JavaScript, including creating basic elements such as headings, text, links, colors, and formatting without the need for HTML and CSS files.

### Using Gitflow:
I have adopted a Gitflow strategy to manage the development process, track changes, and handle releases.

### Summary:
By using JavaScript and the DOM directly to create a web page, this allows me to understand how to interact with the interface without needing HTML or CSS files as they are typically used.
